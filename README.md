# Obsidian Repository
Personal repository for notes made in Obsidian.
### Download and Sync
Download Obsidian and the git plugin from the plugins menu. Ensure that git is enabled in Obsidian and that git is installed on the device and set up (username and email):
* `git config --global user.name 'name'`  
* `git config --global user.email 'nobody@gmail.com'`
### Sync
To begin syncing with the repo, first create the obcon folder and ensure that it is empty. Hit ctrl+p and select "Clone an existing repo". The address should be "http://<DEVELOPERTOKEN>@github.com/nobody-125/obcon.git".
The location to clone to should be the obcon folder, and leave the field empty for a full clone.

The pull option grabs the latest notes from the repo. The commit-and-sync option syncs the local copy to the repo.
