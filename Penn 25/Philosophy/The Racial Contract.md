## *Charles W. Mills, The Racial Contract*
Charles Mills argues that there exists a "Racial Contract", a political, moral and epistemological school of thought that deviates from the classical or contemporary definitions of the Social Contract. According to him, the Racial Contract has the best claim to being an **actual historical fact**, clearly locatable in the events surrounding the creation of the modern world through European colonialism and voyages of conquest, particularly in the 19th century.
### The Contracts
##### Political Contract
* The RC is a set of formal or informal meta-agreements between members of one subset of humans, designated as **"white,"** and coextensive with the class of **full persons.** Individuals are partitioned into "white" and "non-white" populations, where non-whites are categorized as sub-persons and "objects" of the agreement rather than subjects of the agreement.
* The specific purpose of the racial state is to **maintain and reproduce this racial order** and secure the privileges of the full white citizens and the subordination of nonwhites. The "consent" expected of white citizens is conceptualized as consent to the racial order, or **Whiteness**. Race is therefore a central shaping constituent of Western ideals, not an "afterthought" or "deviation".
##### Moral Contract
While mainstream contractarianism is supposedly committed to the **moral equality of all men**, the RC restricts the possession of natural freedom and equality to white men. Nonwhites are designated as born **unfree and unequal**, relegated to a lower rung on the moral ladder. Therefore, the social contract is intended explicitly for white persons only, justified by the grand ethical theories propounded in Western moral and political thought.
##### Epistemological Contract
* The RC is epistemological, prescribing norms for cognition to which signatories must adhere. Because sanctioned reality diverges from actual reality in a racial polity, the RC requires an agreement to **misinterpret the world.**
* Therefore, the RC prescribes an **inverted epistemology** or an **epistemology of ignorance**, resulting in cognitive dysfunctions and "structured blindnesses". 
* White signatories live in an "invented delusional world" or a "racial fantasy land," where white misunderstanding, misrepresentation, evasion, and self-deception are pervasive mental phenomena necessary for conquest, colonization, and enslavement.
### Global Scope and Creation of White Supremacy

According to Mills, the RC is **global**, involving a shift in the ethicojuridical basis of the planet, dividing the world between "men" and "natives" and consolidating global white supremacy. 
* Europeans emerged as "lords of human kind" and have established through a series of conceptual, juridical, and normative acts, including papal bulls, treaties, international law discussions, and formalized legal structures of differential treatment.
* **Religious (Christian/heathen) distinctions:** Gradually translated into secular forms, coalescing into the opposition of **white versus nonwhite.**
* **Subsidiary Exploitation:** The RC manifested through specific subsidiary contracts adjusted for different exploitation methods. * Subject peoples were deemed childlike and incapable of self-rule, requiring the conqueror to bring order and foresight.
	* The "Expropriation Contract", for instance, granted Europeans "absolute dominion" over non-European territories. Since the inhabitants were considered "infidels, heathens, and savages," their title was treated as a **mere right of occupancy**, not property or dominion
	* **The Slavery Contract:** Legitimated the enslavement of Native Americans and Africans based on doctrines of their inherent inferiority (e.g., the _Dred Scott v. Sanford_ decision, which stated that blacks "had no rights which the white man was bound to respect").
	* **The Colonial Contract:** Legitimated European rule over nations in Asia, Africa, and the Pacific. French imperial theorists defined this as a **"Contract of Association"** based on the conviction of the **moral and mechanical superiority of the European race and civilization.**

### Legacy and Complicity

The modern world was expressly created as a racially hierarchical polity, globally dominated by Europeans, where white supremacy was generally assumed and accepted. White settler states like the U.S. were founded on territory **expropriated** from aboriginal inhabitants through policies of extermination and displacement.

The fact that this political struggle for and against racial domination has been largely ignored by mainstream Anglo-American political philosophy reveals either "a disturbing provincialism" or a **"complicity with the terms of the Racial Contract itself".**

##### Racial Contract as an Exploitation Contract

* The Racial Contract is an exploitation contract that determines who gets what economically, leading to global European economic domination and national white racial privilege. 
* Unlike the classic social contract, where economics is background (securing property), the economic dimension of the RC is the **most salient** and is **calculatedly aimed at economic exploitation.**
* The whole purpose is the **differential privileging of whites** and the exploitation of nonwhites’ bodies, land, and resources, thereby securing a **material advantage** for the beneficiaries.
##### Creation of Global White Capital

* The RC creates Europe as the continent that dominates the world. 
* The rise of Europe ("the European miracle") was fundamentally enabled by the **exploitation of the empire** (bullion, plantation slavery profits, fortunes made by colonial companies)
* This process closed off alternative development paths for non-European regions by inserting them into an exploitative colonial network.
* Today, the global economy is still essentially dominated by the former colonial powers and their offshoots (like the Euro-United States), resulting in a world dominated by **white capital.** Economic structures established by the RC continue to **pump wealth from one side of the globe to another.**
##### National White Racial Privilege
* Within nations with a significant nonwhite presence, **whites continue to be privileged.** Although formal exclusion structures have been dismantled, the objective life chances of whites are significantly better.
* In the United States, the huge disparity in white and black wealth (e.g., whites possessing nearly twelve times as much median net worth as blacks) is the **direct outcome of American state policy** and collusion by white citizenry.
* The cumulative value of historical exploitation (unpaid slave labor, underpayment, denial of opportunity) is immense, with estimates suggesting compensation could require **"more than the entire wealth of the United States".**
* This centrality of racial exploitation makes the topic **taboo** and virtually undiscussed in white political theory debates on justice.

Today, the RC’s function is reinforced by a moral psychology (in whites and nonwhites) skewed toward privileging whites and taking the differential racial entitlement status quo as **normatively legitimate.**
