## *Thomas Hobbes: Leviathan*
Thomas Hobbes presupposes that the state of nature exists as a resolution to the natural inequality and insecurity that arises out of a lack of authority. It is defined by three primary characteristics/assumptions:
* Equality: All individuals are of identical competence — i.e., physical strengths and limitations
* Scarcity: Life-sustaining resources are finite
* Egoism: All individuals are motivated towards self-preservation
Since according to *jus naturale* all people naturally have the right to prioritize their own life and security, individuals in the state of nature act in a way that is 
##### The Solution
The three primary goals of the  social contract:
* Individuals resign their individual rights to an unbound sovereign.
* With people unconditionally bound to the authority of the sovereign, the sovereign will seek & enforce peace.
* People living in accordance with the authority of the sovereign, and keep their covenant.

To enforce the social contract is the Leviathan – an absolute sovereign (alienation contract), cannot be challenged politically.
##### The Foole
**The Foole an individual that rationalizes that abiding by the laws of the contract is not advantageous to their interests, and decides not to keep their covenant.** Hobbes believes that for the foole, it remains rational to keep covenant no matter what, because of the consequences that breaking the contract has for one’s reputation (risk aversion and loss of confederacy). However, this concept of the foole has been challenged and tackled from many different angles.

## *Hampton, Moral Rationality*
Jean Hampton compares the social contracts created by Hobbes and a more modern liberal such as Locke:
- Alienation Social Contract (Hobbes): Those under the sovereign resign all individual liberties to the state, effectively leaving no one to challenge the sovereign – shifts the issue of the prisoner’s dilemma to a third party, of which there is no guarantee that they will act in the interest of the people.
- Agency Social Contract (Locke): Individuals transfer limited responsibilities/rights to the sovereign under the assumption that the state will protect their life, liberty and property, but political authority is limited, conditional and consensual. 

- But definition of “consent” is vague (explicit vs. tacit consent, e.g., idea that one agrees to abide by the contract simply by being born in a country)
- Gödel believed the agency social contract is not real – Article V of the constitution, amendments could turn an agency social contract into an alienation social contract

Ultimately presupposes a more moderate version of egoism than what Hobbes believed, giving way to moral rationality: Rather than absolute coercion as the solution to the PD equilibrium Hampton believes that Hobbes’ model of human nature is too pessimistic and overlooks mutual trust and connection between individuals.

- Real-life example might include black-market transactions, where cooperation occurs without enforcement from the state
## *LeBuffe: Reply to the Fool*

Hobbes’ direct reply to the fool is that since keeping a covenant within the state of nature is irrational, any covenants established in the state of nature are not really covenants at all. However, Hobbes also presupposes that the social contract in itself is a form of covenant, demonstrating that genuine covenants are possible in the state of nature, LeBuffe argues that this makes it impossible to dismiss “state of nature” promises as non-covenants, since the social contract, according to Hobbes, is a type of genuine covenant. (Chicken-or-the-egg situation)
- Subsequently, Hobbes’ reply to the fool can only be justified if he can ensure that it is always rational to keep one’s covenant.
- The supposition that all covenants are rational to keep from the fool’s perspective is hazardous: if keeping covenant endangers the fool’s life, is it really rational for him to keep covenant at that very moment?
LeBuffe acknowledges that Hobbes’s reply is sound if the game is iterated  – there are long-term consequences for parties who break covenant (loss of confederacy, insecurity, punishment) in the name of subgame perfect equilibrium - but this still doesn’t strengthen Hobbes’ reply to the foole if a game is not iterated.
