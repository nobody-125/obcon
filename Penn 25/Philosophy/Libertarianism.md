### *Robert Nozick: Anarchy, State, Utopia (Distributive Justice)*
##### Entitlement Theory
* **Justice in Acquisition:** One who acquires something in accordance with the principles of justice is entitled to that good.
* **Justice in Transfer:** If both parties consent to an exchange, a good or property can be legitimately exchanged, provided that coercion or deception plays no part in this exchange.
* **Justice in Rectification:** If the principles of justice are violated in a transaction, the state reserves the right to "rectify" this misdemeanor, which may entail redistribution.
##### Justification of Property Rights
Nozick struggles to justify the existence of property rights; the most common justification for natural right to property is the labor theory, which states that **mixing labor with resources automatically confers ownership.**
* If Nozick were to go out of the way to pour a can of tomato juice into the ocean as a form of labor, would that entitle him to the ocean?
He proposes that adding **value** to property justifies one's rights to it; if one builds a fence and plants crops on a plot of land, they have added value to it, and by extension, own it. But by this logic, removing value from property should waive one's right to that property (e.g., buying a house, only to spray paint it a garish color, making it worth less than before).

**Nozick's arguments subsequently strictly concern justice in transfer, not acquisition. Justice in transfer cannot create new property rights, only perpetuate those that exist already.**
##### Wilt Chamberlain Argument
Argument that Nozick uses to illustrate the patterned principles of just distribution as **incompatible with liberty**
* There exists a society with wealth distribution D1 in accordance with Rawls' difference principle (wealth distributed in a way that maximizes utility of the lowest class)
* There exists Wilt Chamberlain, an extremely popular basketball player in this society
* All people are willing to freely give Chamberlain 25 cents to watch him play basketball over the course of a season
* No other transactions occur.
The result is that Chamberlain has **$250,000,** a significantly larger sum of money than anyone else in society. Despite this wealth inequality, and this new "D2" not being ordered by D1, D2 is still a just distribution, since each agent willingly exchanged their portion of D1 to create D2, and we know that D1 was itself a just distribution. Nozick states that this shows that just distribution is incompatible with liberty, since in order to preserve distribution D1, the state must perpetually interfere with people's ability to freely exchange their D1 shares.
##### Taxation
Nozick views taxation as a form of forced labor and poses the reader with the leisure example; there are two individuals, one who must work a longer period of time to posses the money necessary to purchase a movie ticket, and the other who spends his evening watching a sunset. According to Nozick, there is no difference between taxation (i.e., seizing of the first man's wealth) and forced labor (i.e., if the man watching the sunset was forced to work instead).
