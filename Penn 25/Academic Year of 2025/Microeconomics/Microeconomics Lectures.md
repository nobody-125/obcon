# Econ Lecture 01
### Introduction
- Study of consumer behavior & choice
- Market structures and market failures
- Economic efficiency
- Supply/demand
- Govt. intervention and policy questions
### Opportunity Cost
- In an isolated scenario where one is provided multiple mutually exclusive choices, there exists choices which each have differing "values" that represent the utility or benefit they provide to one party.
- **Opportunity cost** is direct monetary cost plus the _net benefit_ of the next best alternative (e.g., the choice which has the 2nd highest value).
- The mutually exclusive nature of this choice means that there will be a trade-off, regardless of what choice one makes, since you're always sacrificing other choices for the one that you make
##### Cost-benefit
- The cost-benefit analysis rationalizes what the best mutually exclusive choice is through the principle that the benefits of a choice are greater than or equal to its opportunity cost.
# Econ Lecture 02

## Consumer Preference

- If two services or goods are available at no cost or identical cost, how would the consumer rank the goods?
- Refer: Lecture 2-6 Canvas .PPTX, figure 1.
    - Assumption that consumers are rational.
    - If a consumer is rational, more is better.
    - Transitivity: $(F>C)\land(C>J)\rightarrow F>J$.
# Econ Lecture 07-10
### Profit
* Profit (pi) represented by total revenue minus total cost
* **Marginal revenue and marginal cost** tells if firms should increase or decrease output to increase profit:
	* MR equals the change in total revenue over the change in quantity, and MC equals the change in total cost over the change in quantity
	* if MR exceeds MC, profit will increase
	* **Profit is maximized at $MR=MC$.
##### Marginal Revenue
* According to [[Principles of Elasticity|PRINCIPLES OF ELASTICITY]], demand is unit-elastic (assuming linear demand curve). At the midpoint, marginal revenue is zero. Above this point, demand will be elastic and marginal revenue positive, below, demand will be inelastic and marginal revenue negative.
##### Demand
* **Elasticity** affects demand; more sellers leads to more elasticity because there are a greater number of substitutes
* However, since products remain differentiated, demand will never be perfectly elastic, unless if all firms sell identical products.
* **Consumer Expenditure** is total spending on a good, $P\times Q$.
### Short vs. Long Run Operation
* **Short Run:** fixed costs are unavoidable, they've already been sunk. Even if the firm shuts down in short-run, they will still incur these fixed costs. It'll be rational to continue operating if any of the following apply:
$$
TR-TC\geq FC; TR\geq VC; P\geq AVC
$$
* **Long Run:** fixed costs can be avoided if the firm exits, and temporally, it also allows for the possibility of entry by competitors.
	* When competition increases, incumbent firm's demand decreases and becomes more elastic
	* Entry will continue until profits are zero, **when demand is tangent to ATC.**
	
### Maximizing Efficiency
See: [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)|DEADWEIGHT LOSS]] and [[Economic Surplus|ECONOMIC SURPLUS]].
# Econ Lecture 11
### Changes in Supply
* Fixed costs do not change marginal cost: FC cannot affect supply
* Increase in variable costs increases marginal costs
* Change in price does not shift the supply curve
##### Law of Supply
* The law of supply is an economic principle stating that as the price of a good or service increases, the quantity supplied by producers also increases, and vice versa. 
* This relationship creates an upward-sloping supply curve, reflecting how producers respond to price changes to maximize profits.
##### Elasticity of Supply
*Price elasticity of supply* measures the responsiveness of producers to a change in price; $E^S=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}$
##### Market Equilibrium
Most affordable purchasing point for buyer while remaining rational for sellers to sell
Quantity of supply = quantity demand 
	Suppose the detergent industry is perfectly competitive and all firms are identical. The market demand for detergent is given by $P = 60 – 0.1 QD$, and each firm faces the same cost functions: $TC = 100 +q^2$  and  $MC = 2q$. If there are 20 firms in the industry, the market equilibrium price is given by:`
		A: $P=10$
		B: $P=20$
		C: $P=30$
		D: $P=40$
	Start with marginal cost equation of MC=2q and work towards finding the market supply equation. The market supply equation is the individual supply of each firm. $Inv. Supply \rightarrow P=2q$ (since P=MC); Supply: $q=0.5P$. Therefore, market supply is twenty times this amount,  $P=2(Q/20)$; $P=0.1Q$
	Set the market supply equation equal to the market demand equation to obtain an equilibrium quantity of 300, leading to a price of 30.
* **Never set inverse demand equal to supply,** and never set inverse supply equal to demand. Must be INV/INV 
##### Market Efficiency & Short-Run Change
Efficiency achieved when Marginal benefit = marginal cost ($MB=MC$).
* MB represents consumer benefit
* Maximized total surplus is represented by the triangle created between MC and MB; CS is the upper half of that triangle and PS is the lower half.
Short-run change: e.g., petrol prices - reflecting change in supply and demand
# Econ Lecture 12 (Price Controls)
### Price Controls
* Consists of price ceilings and price floors: regulations that determine the minimum/maximum price of a service or good provided
* **Effective** only when set below or above the equilibrium price respectively
* **[[Deadweight Loss (DWL)]]:** The reduction in **total surplus** that occurs as a result of market inefficiency.
##### Effective Controls
* Only a price ceiling that forces price below equilibrium will have any effect, as depicted in the graph below:
![[Pasted image 20251022141956.png]]
* **Deadweight loss is greater** when supply-demand is elastic.
* Likewise, price floors are only effective when they force price above equilibrium:
![[Pasted image 20251022142159.png]]
##### Disequilibrium
Calculating disequilibrium assumes the following knowledge:
* Price floor/ceiling
* Q. Supply equation
* Q. Demand equation
Substitute price floor/ceiling for the price in the supp/demand equations. Disequilibrium is the difference between these two final values.
# Econ Lecture 13 (Introduction to Taxation, 2025-10-20)
### Midterm topics:
* Seller choice
* Price controls
* Taxes and subsidies
* Trade
### Taxes
Taxes create a difference between price paid by buyers and price received by sellers. Depending on who the tax is levied on, it is represented by $P_b-P_s$ or $P_s-P_b$.
# Econ Lecture 14 (Taxes & Subsidies, 2025-10-22)
### Tax Incidence 
* **Tax incidence** refers to who bears the burden of the tax
* Generally, **the more inelastic party bears the greater burden of the tax**
	* *When supply is more elastic, sellers experience less of the burden of the tax*
	* *When demand is more elastic, buyers experience less burden*

> [!NOTE]
> A per-unit tax creates the same price wedge no matter whether it is imposed on the buyer or the seller. This means that regardless of who the tax is put on, the [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)]] is always the same.

##### Effects
* When consumers bear legal incidence, demand curve shifts down vertically by per-unit tax, when producers bear legal incidence, supply curve shifts upward vertically by per-unit tax
* Elasticity ultimately determine not just burden, but also DWL: Less elastic supply-demand leads to smaller DWL and larger revenue, more elastic supply-demand leads to large DWL, less revenue
* What this really means: Less elasticity means **more efficiency,** greater elasticity means **less efficiency**
	* **Philly Soda Tax:** Anticipated revenue of $46 million from the tax, but the result was closer to $39.3 million, illustrating an improper projection of elasticity (demand was more elastic than it actually was).
	* Soda tax decreased soda consumption in the city, but rose outside Philly, since agents can simply drive to the Philadelphia metro (e.g., Levittown) and buy soda at a cheaper price as a substitute to soda in the city
### Subsidy
* **Subsidies** are the opposite of a tax since they harm government revenue and are of benefit to consumers/business
* The government invests money in the market to encourage activity in the sector: the federal government can subsidize high-speed rail in a state to expedite/aid construction, or subsidize research and development at a university
* Creates a wedge between the price sellers keep and consumers pay
Subsidies are calculated in a manner similar to how taxes are.
##### Comparison to Tax on Buyers
* A tax would generally shift the consumer demand curve left/down
* A subsidy given to buyers shifts demand right/up, creating a new equilibrium quantity which has a higher price for sellers.
* Since the consumers are subsidized by the government, you still pay less, despite this higher price, and since the price is higher, the seller receives more money.
##### Comparison to Tax on Sellers
* A tax imposed on sellers shifts the seller supply curve left/up
* A subsidy given to sellers shifts the seller supply curve right/down
* Buyers now pay a lower price, but sellers receive more since they are subsidized by the government
##### Effect on Surplus
* [[Economic Surplus|ECONOMIC SURPLUS]] is the consumer surplus triangle (CS) + producer surplus (PS) ($CS+PS$)
* **Consumer Surplus:** Upper triangle will expand because of subsidy, increasing CS
* **Producer Surplus:** Area below the price received, will massively expand
* This means that both the CS and PS triangles will overlap, this overlapping area is what is subsidized by the government.
* The result is that the overlapping area represents gov't expenditure.
##### Surplus Represented by Graph
![[Pasted image 20251022125128.png]]
* Observe that consumer surplus before would be A+ the area between the equilibrium latitude, now it is A+B+E after the subsidy. Likewise, producer surplus would be expanded from C+ the area between equilibrium attitude.
* $TS=A+B+E+B+C+D=A+2B+C+D$, subtract the government subsidy cost to get the actual TS of $A+B+C-F$
* Area F represents DWL from the subsidy
* DWL is generated because we've moved away from the efficient quantity.

Consider the market for umbrellas in Rainy island, where demand  is $P = 30 - 2Q_D$, and supply is $P = Q_S$. The price of each umbrella on the global market is $6. If Rainy island imposes a tariff $t=4$ per unit, how much tariff revenue will that generate?
* $30-2Q_d=Q_s$, therefore, $3Q=30$ and $Q=10; P=10$
* A tariff of $4 per unit would make imports the same price as purchasing domestically
* Zero tariff revenue will be generated
