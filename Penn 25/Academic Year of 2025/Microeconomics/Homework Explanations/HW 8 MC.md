1. Consider a monopoly producing widgets and facing a downward sloping market demand and upward sloping marginal cost. Suppose producing widgets creates pollution. There is no government intervention in the market. The monopolist develops a technology that allows it to perfectly price discriminate against consumers. Which of the following could be true in this market?
	1. The single-price monopolist produces the socially efficient quantity
	2. The PPD monopolist produces at the socially efficient quantity
	3. The PPD monopolist produces at a more elastic part of the demand curve than the single-price monopolist
	4. None.

**Answer: The single-price monopolist will produce at the socially efficient quantity.**

> [!NOTE] Explanation
> Because of the negative externality, $MSC>MPC$. The socially efficient quantity Q<sub>E</sub> is at the intersection of MSC and Demand. 
> 
> With PPD, the firm produces at the intersection of MPC and Demand, so it overproduces ($Q_{PPD}>Q_E$): it does not produce the socially efficient quantity.
> With a single price, the firm produces at the intersection of MPC and MR, which is below demand. So the firm produces less than with perfect price discrimination ($Q_M<Q_{PPD}$). So:
> 
> Q<sub>M</sub> corresponds to a point higher on the demand curve than QPPD, where demand is more elastic.
> And therefore, Potentially, it could produce the socially efficient quantity (it is possible that $Q_M=Q_E$)

2. Consider a market with a downward sloping demand. You find that a firm chooses to produce at a quantity where $MR=MC$. The product that this firm produces creates a negative externality. Under which of the following conditions could this be a profit maximizing outcome and efficient output level?
	1. If it is in a perfectly competitive industry.
	2. If the firm is a single price monopoly

**Answer: When the firm is a single price monopoly (2)**

3. Larry's Laptops Inc. is a perfectly price discriminating monopolist that produces laptops with a marginal cost of $MC = Q$. Larry's Laptops faces a demand curve characterized by the following equation: $P = 1500-2Q$. Which of the following statements is/are true?
	1. Larry's Laptops' marginal revenue curve is given by $MR = 1500-4Q$.
	2. Larry's Laptops charges $P = 500$ for every laptop sold.
	3. Larry's Laptops charges $P = 900$ for every laptop sold.

**Answer: None**

4. ABC Inc is the only seller on the local flower market. It faces a downward sloping demand curve $P = 10-Q$, where P is the market price. ABC Inc has a constant marginal cost $MC = 2$. If the firm is able to perfectly price discriminate instead of charging a single price:
	1. Profit increases by 4
	2. Profit increases by 16
	3. Profit increases by 32
	4. Not enough information.

**Answer: Profit increases by 16**

5. Suppose PECO Energy is a natural monopolist in Philadelphia and faces a constant marginal cost of $2. The government provides PECO with a per-unit subsidy that causes the company to produce the revenue-maximizing quantity. What is the amount of the per-unit subsidy?
	1. $1
	2. $2
	3. $3
	4. Not enough information

**Answer: $2**

> [!NOTE] Explanation
> The revenue maximizing quantity is such that demand is unit elastic, i.e. $MR = 0$. The firm always maximizes profit, so with the subsidy s it produces the quantity such that $MR=MC-s$.
