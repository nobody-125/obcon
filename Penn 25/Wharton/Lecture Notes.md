## Summary
A trust is a firm that is extremely large by historical standards. The antitrust would appear to most commonly refer to the use of government intervention and law to prevent or disrupt the growth and/or existence of a trust.

Antitrust is most often used in markets where there are a small number of firms and when a monopoly will lead to market inefficiency.
##### History
- 1895: The Sugar Trust (American Sugar Refining Co)
- 1905: Meat Packing (Swift & Co)
- 1911: The Oil Trust (Standard Oil and John D. Rockefeller)
- Interstate Commerce (1887) Sherman (1890)/Clayton + FTC (1914) Acts: First implementations of antitrust law in the US, however, even to this day, there is no consistent code or "rulebook" on trusts.
	- Monopoly: Originally defined as an exclusive grant from the government, Sherman Act expands this definition to refer to a dominant firm.
### Critiques and Perspectives
##### Progressive View
The progressive criticism of trust is that they are bad for small business. The most obvious example in big tech, for instance, which has been discussed in utilitarianism and liberalism, is NETFLIX, their main rival having been Blockbuster at the time, when they entered the market, they had innovated a method that significantly reduced costs and labor. Whereas Blockbuster required consumers to borrow-and-return to a brick & mortar location, Netflix would begin as a mailing service, entailing the displacement of competitors. When Netflix and other services like Hulu transitioned to streaming, it would also appear that the broader communications industry was disrupted as well, with optical disc manufacturers, CD stores and others in the industry likely being a loser in this situation.

Brandeis lies on the polarized side of the spectrum, favoring smaller firms and anti-monopoly tradition. The most famous case is A&P who took advantage of economies of scale to provide groceries to consumers, particularly during the depression, at a cheaper price. Brandeis would try to disrupt this environment and desired a progressive tax on multi-store grocers that would have completely destroyed them.
##### Efficiency Thesis (F.A. Hayek, Friedman)
Perspective that merger and integration create no inefficiency at all
### Inefficiencies
Without taking into account marginal social cost and benefit, monopoly and oliogpoly tend to create inefficiencies. The supply is often reduced and market price is increased. The Sherman Act attempts to reduce these inefficiencies by completely outlawing the restraint of trade and monopolization insofar as the nature of such activity is anticompetitive.
