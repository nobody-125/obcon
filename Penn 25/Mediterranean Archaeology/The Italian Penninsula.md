## Week 08 (2025-10-20)
### Etruscan Society
* Significant parallels to Greek society, but distinctive enough to raise questions about their ontogeny
* Hippodamian layout: City planning resembled that of neighboring civilization (separation of public space and the temples).
##### Architecture
* Exposed to Greek ideas and adopted features like the concept of marble-clad stone structures used in Southern Italy (Magna Graecia)
* **Ionic/Doric Greek Orders:** These Greek architectural guidelines were recycled into the native **Tuscan Order** in Etruria.
	* Etruscan mudbrick, wood and terracotta building materials vs. Greek stone and marble
	* Tall podium accessible by a set of stairs vs. the Greek low three-step platform
	* Accessible exclusively from the front, while Greek buildings were generally accessible from all sides
	* Three cellas versus just one or two, no peristyle
	* Strong emphasis on the front of the structure, while Greek architecture permitted a nonlinear exploration of the building.
	* Widely-spaced, non-fluted columns - goes against most guidelines for Greek columns.
##### Artwork and Religious Belief
* The Etruscan artists adopted some Greek elements in their sculptures; the slight smile and left foot forward was observed in Greek *kouroi*, **exemplified by the Aplu (Apollo) from Veii.** Etruscans copied the classical **black/red-figure painting** methods used in clayworking. **The Greek Archaic Convention** of dark-skinned men and women with light skin was replicated by the Etruscans.
* However, Etruscan artists strayed from Greek art in many ways, notably in the arts' use; tomb paintings were significant for their funerary purpose. This emphasis on afterlife and death was not taken from Greek culture, but it's own separate development:
	* **Burial:** Etruscan tombs were imitations of houses, seemingly more symmetrical with Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife rather than Greek beliefs. Inside Etruscan tombs are personal items like jewelry, razors, swords, further illustrating greater alignment with Egyptian sotierology rather than Greek. Tombs were elaborately decorated with paintings, doors represented the passageway into the afterlife.
	* **Cremation:** Ashes and bones of the deceased persons were placed into a cinerary urn, often times molded into the shape of a home.
* Etruscan religion and belief was unmistakably similar to that of Greece, but with slight differences: Zeus' name was changed to Tinia, showing a correlation to Greek religion, but illustrating distinctiveness.
* Women were given a larger role in Etruscan artwork and probably society, since funerary art depicts married couples reclining together at banquets, and women participating alongside men.
## Week 09 (2025-10-27)
### *Zanker, Pompeii*
##### Architecture
* Tufa as a common building material due to Pompeii's proximity to volcanic activity
* Greek influence 
* The size of houses can be used to analyze the wealth of the population, in accordance with these, there are signs of affluence in the majority of the city. 
	* Largest houses in Oscan Pompeii significantly larger than those in Greek cities
	* House of the Faun: Samnite-period with strong Greek influence (e.g., ionic columns, copies of famous Greek artwork, etc.)
	* Smaller houses likely located to the east of the forum: wooden construction explains why there are no signs of these houses, whereas the tufa-built houses are more well-preserved
* Public architecture similarly illustrates Pompeiian appreciation for Greek culture
	* **The Forum:** Central political/commercial hub, containing administrative buildings and an area for trade
	* **Amiptheater:** Built in 70 BC, served 20,000 spectators of gladitorial contests, illustrating the emphasis on physical strength and competition
