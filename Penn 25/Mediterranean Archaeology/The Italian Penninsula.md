# Week 08 (2025-10-20)
## Etruscan Society
* Significant parallels to Greek society, but distinctive enough to raise questions about their ontogeny
* Hippodamian layout: City planning resembled that of neighboring civilization (separation of public space and the temples).
##### Architecture
* Exposed to Greek ideas and adopted features like the concept of marble-clad stone structures used in Southern Italy (Magna Graecia)
* **Ionic/Doric Greek Orders:** These Greek architectural guidelines were recycled into the native **Tuscan Order** in Etruria.
	* Etruscan mudbrick, wood and terracotta building materials vs. Greek stone and marble
	* Tall podium accessible by a set of stairs vs. the Greek low three-step platform
	* Accessible exclusively from the front, while Greek buildings were generally accessible from all sides
	* Three cellas versus just one or two, no peristyle
	* Strong emphasis on the front of the structure, while Greek architecture permitted a nonlinear exploration of the building.
	* Widely-spaced, non-fluted columns - goes against most guidelines for Greek columns.
##### Artwork and Religious Belief
* The Etruscan artists adopted some Greek elements in their sculptures; the slight smile and left foot forward was observed in Greek *kouroi*, **exemplified by the Aplu (Apollo) from Veii.** Etruscans copied the classical **black/red-figure painting** methods used in clayworking. **The Greek Archaic Convention** of dark-skinned men and women with light skin was replicated by the Etruscans.
* However, Etruscan artists strayed from Greek art in many ways, notably in the arts' use; tomb paintings were significant for their funerary purpose. This emphasis on afterlife and death was not taken from Greek culture, but it's own separate development:
	* **Burial:** Etruscan tombs were imitations of houses, seemingly more symmetrical with Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife rather than Greek beliefs. Inside Etruscan tombs are personal items like jewelry, razors, swords, further illustrating greater alignment with Egyptian sotierology rather than Greek. Tombs were elaborately decorated with paintings, doors represented the passageway into the afterlife.
	* **Cremation:** Ashes and bones of the deceased persons were placed into a cinerary urn, often times molded into the shape of a home.
* Etruscan religion and belief was unmistakably similar to that of Greece, but with slight differences: Zeus' name was changed to Tinia, showing a correlation to Greek religion, but illustrating distinctiveness.
* Women were given a larger role in Etruscan artwork and probably society, since funerary art depicts married couples reclining together at banquets, and women participating alongside men.
# Week 09 (2025-10-27)
## *Zanker, Pompeii*
##### Architecture
* Tufa as a common building material due to Pompeii's proximity to volcanic activity
* Greek influence 
* The size of houses can be used to analyze the wealth of the population, in accordance with these, there are signs of affluence in the majority of the city. 
	* Largest houses in Oscan Pompeii significantly larger than those in Greek cities
	* House of the Faun: Samnite-period with strong Greek influence (e.g., ionic columns, copies of famous Greek artwork, etc.)
	* Smaller houses likely located to the east of the forum: wooden construction explains why there are no signs of these houses, whereas the tufa-built houses are more well-preserved
* Public architecture similarly illustrates Pompeiian appreciation for Greek culture
	* **The Forum:** Central political/commercial hub, containing administrative buildings and an area for trade
	* **Amiptheater:** Built in 70 BC, served 20,000 spectators of gladitorial contests, illustrating the emphasis on physical strength and competition

# Week 11 (2025-11-10)
## *Hopkins, Colosseum*

##### Remarks by Mark Twain
* It is difficult to determine the "high emotional writing" that Twain had in mind regarding the Colosseum and its gladiatorial games. Twain declared he was the 'only free white man of mature age' who had written about the monument since Byron without quoting the poet's phrase about the Colosseum being "butchered" to make a Roman holiday.
* Twain believed he was the first person to see the quote in print about seventeen or eighteen thousand times, suggesting it had grown tiresome.
* While Twain had a point, addressing the rhetoric of the response does not solve the underlying dilemma for the nineteenth-century visitor: how to reconcile the murderous games with the magnificence of the Colosseum.
##### Modern Relevance
* The **dominant central cross indulgences and the Friday sermon** emphasize the Colosseum as a powerful intersection between the ancient world and the modern religious world. The Pope still visits every year to perform the rituals of Good Friday.
* The modern era has even less peace and quiet than the nineteenth century:
	* The roughly 3 million visitors annually today far surpass the numbers of those who enjoyed a moonlit walk through the arena in the nineteenth century.
	* Modern tourists are served by an industry that substitutes illuminated plastic, candy, and fridge-magnets for the dried flowers that a historical Handbook deemed appropriate souvenirs.
* Twentieth-century tourism is both similar to and different from the experience of tourists a hundred and fifty years ago: There is no regular moonlight access or private floodlighting on request today. A **'modernist lift'** has replaced the old staircase, granting access to the upper floors. Tourists can no longer climb to the topmost level but must make do with a fabulous view from short of half the way up.
##### Origin and Construction
* Nero's Lake was a site rediscovered in the sixteenth century. The original Golden House included a dining room with a revolving ceiling and a colossal bronze statue (likely Nero himself), about 30 meters tall.
	* The statue stood next to a private lake, surrounded by buildings representing cities. Recent excavation suggests the lake was a relatively small, formal affair, contrary to the ancient report that it was 'more like a sea'.
	* Vespasian took advantage of the empty, devastated land left by the Great Fire of Rome in A.D. 64. The Colosseum was founded on the site of Nero's infamous private lake This was meant to be a **brilliant political gesture** intended to obliterate Nero's memory.
	* Martial marked the opening of the building in A.D. 80. Vespasian died in A.D. 79 and did not see the final completion.
* The inscription, dedicated in honor of Titus, was found to have originally carried a different text, reconstructed from dowel holes, and suggests the Colosseum was built with money from the spoils of the Jewish rebellion.
	* This point is emphasized by **extant Jewish inscriptions** in the Colosseum, or possibly the absence of non-existent Jewish inscriptions. (The source structure here is complex, noting an ingenuity in recent discovery of an inscribed block).
	* The inscribed block of stone lay around in the arena for centuries, serving as a resting place for Victorian tourists.
##### Political Purpose and Spectator Hierarchy
* • The Colosseum was an innovation of a **permanent amphitheatre**, a novel concept at the time since most games were shown at temporary, wooden theatres.
* The sight of Nero's new amphitheatre left the elite (senatorial class) lacking the mechanical sophistication of the mob. Gatherings, even for pleasure, implied a dangerous commodity in the eyes of the elite.
* The dangerous commodity significantly changed with the Colosseum, designed to appease the urban mob and the Roman emperor.
	* By the mid-first century BC, the Republican system had imploded, culminating in the one-man rule of Julius Caesar.
	* Under the emperors, the bulk of the city took on new scale and permanence. Elections were instantly replaced by the Emperor and his nominees.

The Colosseum, as the largest covered building in Rome, featured covered seating for the Vestal Virgins, the empress, and Augustus. It would serve as a "brilliantly constructed and enclosed world" that packed the emperor, elite, and subjects together "like sardines in a tin". Spectators were **hierarchically ordered by status**: higher ranks sat near the front, and the masses sat at the back. This arrangement forced spectators to acknowledge each other.
* The emperor was expected to be cheered by ovations. The emperor would occasionally shower the spectators with gifts, often following the prospect of violent death.
##### The Opening Events (A.D. 80) and Naval Battles
* Titus officially opened the new emperor in A.D. 80. The opening included an extravaganza of fighting, beast hunts, and bloodshed. Titus' biographer, Suetonius, claimed that thousands were killed during these celebrations (not necessarily within the Colosseum itself). Modern scholars suggest the estimated half a million animals killed referred to 'on every single day' of the performance. Dio writes about 9000 animal deaths, acknowledging the difficulty of calculating the correct tally.
	* Dio states that **Titus suddenly filled the arena with water** and brought in horses and bulls taught to swim. The context suggests the water displays actually took place in a different, purpose-built location.
* The naval battle involved 3000 men and was staged in a **special facility constructed by the first emperor Augustus**.
* The basement of the arena could not be waterproofed because it was constructed of travertine stone. The basement was built first, before the complex machinery, which allowed for the _option_ of flooding.
##### Gladiatorial Dramatics and Cruelty
* The public amphitheatre replaced Nero's private one. Dio records animals fighting each other (e.g., elephants versus rhinoceroses) and animals fighting humans.
* Martial recorded the opening in _The Book of the Shows_ and referred to the scenes as **"exquisite inventiveness of cruelty"**.
* The opening celebrations drew a distinction between the Roman citizen and the masked ranks of foreigners. The foreigners included the exotic polyglot crowd from Northern Greece, Samaritans, Syrians, Germans, and Ethiopians. These foreigners often sported a different style of cruelty, such as quasi-judicial fighting.
* Punishment was sometimes induced by condemnation to the games: Tertullian, a Christian writer, described criminals being picked out as actors in a play, such as a man crucified after being 'turned alive' by a bear. Martial focused on the crucifixion of the legendary bandit **Laureolus**, who was murdered by a bear imported from Scotland.
* Apuleius' novel _The Golden Ass_ tells of a hero condemned to lose his life by forced intercourse with an ass in the amphitheatre, an event often interpreted as a fantastical or magical accident.
##### Economics and Scheduling
* The regular performances were not sponsored by the Emperor, but instead aristocrats. These Colosseum shows fed a popular image of sadistic excess, however, legislation limited the number of gladiators an 'ordinary' aristocrat could present.
* **Symmachus**, a defender of traditional Roman religion, spent 2000 pounds of gold on shows. This sum was enough to feed nearly 20,000 peasant families for a year. His letter provides factual details about the expense and troubles of acquiring animals, noting that bear cubs acquired were sometimes emaciated, and also mentions 29 gladiators who strangled each other the evening before their performance.
* Fourth-century A.D. calendars suggest only **ten days were devoted to gladiatorial games** (compared to four for theatrical shows and sixty-four for chariot racing).
* The sequence of the day's events was fixed by rule or custom:
	* Morning: Wild animal hunts (exotic species vs. trained marksmen/hunters).
	* Lunch Break: Public executions (mythological forms or "just plain killing").
	* Afternoon: Gladiatorial bouts proper.
##### Gladiatorial Combat and Ritual
* Gladiators usually fought in pairs, supervised by trainers and umpires. Stretcher bearers (dressed as gods of the Underworld) removed the dead and wounded.
* Victors were handsomely rewarded with fame and lavish presents from the sponsor, but the wounded or defeated gladiator were at the mercy of the audience:
	* The gladiator signaled surrender by holding up his little finger.
	* The crowd voiced their preference for killing or sparing by putting their thumbs up or down. Many of the _ombobes_ (spectators) probably had a vested interest in the outcome, having placed bets the night before.
	* However, the final decision to kill or spare was up to the sponsor.
* Roman gladiatorial combat was characterized by exposed bare flesh, making the fighters visibly vulnerable. The types of gladiators were indicated by carefully distinguished titles, but matching up gladiator titles with visual images (sculpture, graffiti, paintings, mosaics) is difficult.
* The visual evidence is the only way historians have hoped to work out the details of costume and fighting methods.
	* The helmet for the _secutor_ (Pursuer) covered the whole face except for two tiny eye-holes
	* Helmets with a broad brim were probably worn by _Thracians_ and _murmillones_
	* The general absence of fish emblems suggests the overall 'fish' shape gave the _murmillo_ his title
	* Ancient artists found nets a tricky subject to represent
* It is difficult to determine the exact difference between early fighter types, such as whether the Thracian was the same as a _hoplomachus_.
* A startling, frequently reproduced image is a unique bronze **trimallium** (bell chimes) from Herculaneum. The figure is a gladiator attacking his elongated penis, which is half-transformed into a panther or wolf. This figure is considered an apt icon for the Roman cosmology of desire. This creature bears little resemblance to other gladiator images and may have been a theatrical or mime artist, rather than a gladiator in the strict sense.
##### Reconstruction of the Programme
* Gladiators were allowed to wear display kit, which may have allowed the imagination of British university students wearing gowns and mortar boards for graduation.
* Modern students of Roman culture often combine multiple ancient references—a first-century letter, a history aside, a Roman satirist's joke, and a Christian propagandist's comment—to create a reconstructed 'programme'.
* This reconstruction often mistakenly applies events that occurred at the Circus Maximus or other amphitheatres to the Colosseum
* Seneca wrote a letter concerned with the 'moral dangers' of crowds before the Colosseum was built.
The sources essentially treat the history of the Colosseum like an archaeological dig itself, starting with modern perceptions (Twain, tourism), moving through the physical evidence (foundations, inscriptions), detailing the political reasons for its creation (Nero vs. Vespasian), and finally dissecting the specific, often confused, details of the performances (naval battles, gladiator categories, and the famous, likely misattributed, dying salute).
## *Elsner, The Art of the Roman Empire AD 100-450*
##### The Center’s Mechanism for Propagation and Assimilation (Second Century AD)
The Roman center relied heavily on visual culture to propagate imperial identity and secure political control, though this process was met with complex local reactions.
* Visual Propagation of Identity: Roman identity was widely promoted and propagated partly through the visual culture of Roman architecture and art. This culture, along with Rome’s fundamental political and civic life, was maintained through various rituals and customs.
* Adoption by Elites: Provincials, including Gauls, Libyans, and Levantines, adopted Roman social structures, a process often driven by the desire to imitate deeply Roman institutions as a means of validating their local status. Elites sometimes attempted to appear excessively Romanized.
* Architectural Standardization: Cities in the periphery readily adopted Roman civic standards, including specific urban planning features such as forums, basilicas, arcaded streets, temples, baths, and specialized Roman streets. Even the countryside was visibly marked by Roman infrastructure, criss-crossed by Roman roads and aqueducts.
* Imperial Icons and Local Context: Imperial art offered generalized icons, such as the triumphal arch, intended to assimilate the message of imperial control across the provinces regarding military strength and culture. However, the message of Roman hegemony required the specific local contexts and attitudes of the periphery to gradually transform the imperial message. Furthermore, displays of local tradition often functioned as compensation for a lack of political influence.
* The Complexity of Romanization: During the second century, Romanization was a complex process involving a mixture of denial, acceptance, and resistance to local traditions, illustrating that Roman identity successfully accommodated these traditions.
##### The Center Accommodating the Periphery (Hadrian and the Severans)
Starting with Hadrian, there was a growing recognition by the imperial center of the political and cultural importance of provincial origins, leading to a shift in artistic focus. Emperor Hadrian, himself a **Romanized Spaniard**, exemplified this accommodation. He maintained Roman dominance while actively adopting cultural roles, such as sometimes **masquerading as a Greek** or presenting himself as a scholar. Hadrian oversaw an empire-wide mission of public building, drawing inspiration from places like Greece and North Africa.

* Hadrian’s Arch in Athens explicitly demonstrates this blended identity, serving as a clear affirmation of Greek traditions while also celebrating Roman power. Similarly, his Temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens was a major act of generosity toward the city, fulfilling the long-standing vision of the Athenian commonwealth.
* Subsequent emperors, including Commodus, Pertinax, and especially the Severans (Septimius Severus, Caracalla), increasingly emphasized their provincial origins. This culminated in Caracalla granting citizenship to nearly all free inhabitants of the empire in AD 212.
* Septimius Severus, a native of **Lepcis Magna in North Africa**, actively celebrated his provincial roots through art and politics. His construction projects, such as the Temple of Hercules, demonstrated a **gradual movement of the empire's artistic center of gravity towards the periphery**, as materials were imported from diverse regions like Greece and Asia Minor.
* **Dynamic Political Art:** Severus’s monumental art, like the arch in the Roman Forum, utilized traditional iconography (such as the triumphal chariot) but also conveyed a **dynamic political message** celebrating the emperor and his sons as rulers of a diverse empire.
##### Artistic Divergence and the Ascendancy of Provincial Capitals (Late Antiquity)
By the third century, political decentralization led to new provincial centers asserting their own distinct and powerful aesthetic styles, challenging Rome’s classical dominance. The increasing emphasis on the peripheries resulted in the **supreme elimination of the empire’s centralization**. The **Tetrarchy** shifted key symbolic, administrative, and artistic centers away from Rome, establishing them in provincial capitals such as **Salónica (Thessaloniki) or Trier**.

* During this period, Rome was often treated *merely as the old capital*. New imperial foundations like the basilica in Trier, built by the Tetrarchy, were designed to reflect the functional needs of the moment, eschewing the need to be elaborate.
* **Emergence of New Aesthetics:** The provincial centers fostered distinct artistic styles, particularly those that are **non-naturalistic** (often labeled by modern scholars as 'sub-antique' or 'expressionist'). These styles contrasted sharply with the classicism frequently favored in Rome.
* **Formal Provincial Art:** The **triumph panel of Galerius from Salonica** is cited as an example of this anti-classicizing style, characterized by **high formality**. This provincial aesthetic represented the powerful political currents emanating from these new imperial capitals.
* **Transformation of the Center:** Ultimately, while the old Rome declined in importance, it was succeeded by the **New Christian Rome**, which was founded and embellished to serve as the new hub of the Christian empire, collecting statuary both classical and contemporary.

This entire dynamic suggests that Roman art was less a product of singular, centralized creation and more like a river system: though the source (Rome) was powerful, the tributaries (the provinces) continually fed into it, enriching the flow and eventually altering the main channel's course and destination. 
Elsner illustrates a two-way dynamic between the state and the cultures that it inhibited; there was a need to assimilate the periphery into Roman culture, but also a need for the government to accomodate to the diverse array of Mediterranean peoples that the empire included.
# Week 12 (2025-11-18)
## *Flohr, Femurs and food regimes in the Roman world*

Since the turn of the millennium, there has been a proliferation of studies discussing the quality of Roman food regimes. Progress includes studying evidence for **stature** on a larger scale to assess changes in average human body length over the long term, noting the work of Koepke and Baten (2005) for Europe, and Giannecchini and Moggi-Cecchi (2008) for Italy. Scholars have also begun to systematically analyze skeletal remains for indications of ill health associated with structural malnutrition, such as **porotic hyperostosis** and **dental enamel hypoplasia**.
##### The Debate and Methodological Challenges
Scholars have not yet reached a consensus on what the skeletal record indicates about Roman food regimes. There is an **optimistic camp** highlighting Roman dietary achievement and a **pessimistic camp** highlighting Roman dietary shortcomings.

 The "frontal opposition" between these two positions raises questions about how solid conclusions derived from skeletal remains currently are, suggesting the evidence may need to be approached with more caution. The most crucial problem in combining skeletal data and economic history is the difficulty for individual scholars to completely master the theoretical and methodological complexities of both fields. 
 * There is a vast difference in **publication culture**: osteoarchaeologists favor a rigidly analytical scientific tradition, whereas Roman historians lean toward a more rhetorical classical tradition, prioritizing palatable historical scenarios over detailed methodological discussion.
 * **Raw osteoarchaeological data are often extremely inaccessible**, and key arguments sometimes rely on partially unpublished evidence, such as Klein Goldewijk's work. The lack of standardized publication conventions is typical for a fast-developing field.
 * The relationship between the excavated skeletal record and historical reality is extremely complex, influenced heavily by **excavation practice** (e.g., rescue excavations for infrastructure projects like rail lines or shopping malls)
 * The evidence is heavily biased: it is **skewed towards Italy and temperate Europe** at the expense of regions like North Africa, the Nile, and Asia Minor.
 * Furthermore, the known skeletal record favors centralized necropolises over isolated graves, thus privileging evidence from **cities and large settlements over the countryside**. People living on farmsteads are structurally underrepresented, as are groups buried outside necropolises.
##### The Stature Debate (Short Romans, Tall Romans)
The **optimistic position** (e.g., Kron) argued that adult males in Roman Italy averaged around 168.3 cm tall, suggesting Romans were "significantly taller than the nineteenth century working class populations".
* Kron’s argument is critiqued because Roman recruitment heights mentioned by Vegetius (_De Re Militari_ 1.5) are not directly comparable to 19th-century heights due to different warfare technology.
* Moreover, Vegetius’s high figures applied only to the cavalry and the first cohort, and he suggested such heights were exceptional in his day.

A fundamental methodological problem in the stature debate is that differing formulae are used to calculate height from long bones (e.g., Kron used Trotter and Gleser for ‘whites’ or Olivier; others use Pearson’s formula or Trotter and Gleser for ‘blacks’). Klein Goldewijk and Jacobs (2013, 11) have argued that these methods are essentially unreliable and that one should compare bones, not reconstructed heights.

Even if Romans were taller than 19th-century working classes, the comparison is problematic; Greco-Roman stature should be judged against Mediterranean food economies of the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age, and those of late antiquity and the medieval period.

Scholars with a **pessimistic view** (e.g., Giannecchini and Moggi-Cecchi) argued that the Roman imperial period saw a marked **decrease in stature**, followed by an increase in late antiquity, while Koepke and Baten advocated a pan-European increase coinciding with the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.
* A crucial problem with Giannecchini and Moggi-Cecchi’s work is that their imperial period evidence is heavily concentrated in the city of Rome and its direct environment (56% of skeletons), while pre-Roman and post-Roman data come from other regions in Italy.
* This bias suggests their analysis mainly indicates that people in the Roman metropolis were shorter than people elsewhere in Italy during other periods, not a generalized decline in body height in the Roman world.
* Shorter stature in Rome might not be related to malnourishment, but rather to factors like **endemic malaria**, structural overpopulation, or bad hygiene.

The analysis by Koepke and Baten, operating on a high level of abstraction, struggles with similar biases, including low sample sizes for the Roman Mediterranean (e.g., 11 skeletons for the second century). Their suggestion of an increase in body length following the fall of the Western Roman Empire coincides with a period where the largest number of skeletons comes from southern Germany and the Rhine Region.
##### Inconclusive Evidence and Population Pressure

It may be concluded that skeletal evidence is **essentially inconclusive** regarding the historical development of stature. It is difficult to reconstruct local developments over the long term because few large necropolises span more than three or four centuries, with Rome being a possible but complicated exception.

* Scholars are likely to continue interpreting skeletal remains based on their existing models of the nutritional status of Romans, which were developed from other data.
* The key question of whether Roman undernourishment was bigger, smaller, or comparable to pre- and post-Roman phases hinges primarily on the issue of **population pressure**: whether Rome’s imperial food economies operated close to their maximum capacity.

The consistency of ancient Mediterranean communities sending out surplus population (e.g., via colonization) suggests that overpopulation was a familiar issue but traditionally had a solution: migration. Although Scheidel (2009, 70) argued the early imperial Mediterranean was close to its maximum carrying capacity, there is **no direct evidence unequivocally supporting this claim**
* Emperors like Augustus and Trajan founded cities in marginal regions, suggesting enough under-explored land was available, although colonization was not widely used as a demographic instrument in the imperial period.
* The Roman Empire, outside the central Mediterranean, does not appear to have been very densely populated. Settlement data shows entire regions appearing rather empty (e.g., river valleys in Gaul/Spain, the Gharb region, parts of the Ebro basin).
* This evidence suggests that population pressure was **not** getting the better of the Roman food economy on an empire-wide level

Therefore, undernourishment in the Roman world was likely not directly related to the sheer quantity of people. Instead, there may have been **friction undernourishment** in some larger urban communities, particularly the Roman metropolis, due to the malfunctioning of local and regional food markets.
* Institutions like the _annona_ (in Rome) and municipal grain funds (_sitonia_) in the Greek East emphasize the potential for malnutrition in urban contexts.
* This social environment suggests that those who grew up in bigger urban centers had a higher chance of suffering from undernourishment during childhood, potentially resulting in shorter stature. If average stature is inversely related to the proportion of people in large cities, Romans might be slightly shorter than their predecessors and successors, lending a slightly stronger case to the pessimistic side, though caution is advised due to biases in the data.
# Week 14 (2025-12-01)
### *Kleiner, Early Christian Art and Architecture*
The development of Early Christian art marks a significant transition from the Classical world to the medieval period. This era saw the rise of patronage in **Rome and Trier** and the strategic use of art by Constantine for political purposes. The earliest examples of Christian art date to the second and third centuries and are primarily preserved in the **Roman catacombs**. Before large-scale churches were established, Christian services occurred in private settings, often in community houses, such as the example excavated at Dura-Europos. As the Christian populace grew, there was an urgent need for substantial new buildings to support their liturgy, worship, discipline, and administration.

##### Old Saint Peter's Basilica (Rome, Begun c. 320)

Constantine initiated a major architectural building campaign, which included the construction of **Old Saint Peter's Basilica** on the Vatican hill in Rome. This location was intentionally chosen to define a new Christian center, separate from the pagan temples and ancient centers of the city.

 * **Site and Purpose:** The basilica was erected over the spot traditionally believed to be the place where the apostle Peter was martyred and buried. The building served as a **martyrium** and replaced an earlier, more modest shrine (_trophy_) that marked Peter’s grave.
 * **Architectural Form and Layout:** Old Saint Peter's was designed as a **five-aisled basilica,** utilizing a plan adapted from Roman civic basilicas and imperial audience halls.
	 * The structure included a central **nave**, four flanking aisles, and an **apse** at the western end. The apse was bordered by aisles and often had an ambulatory or crypt.
	 * The total length of the structure measured **395 feet.**
	 * A defining architectural element was the **transept**, which traversed the building near the apse, giving the plan a T-shape. The transept served to house Peter's tomb and also functioned as a burial place for Christian dignitaries.
	 * Worshipers accessed the structure through a large **atrium** and then passed into the basilica via a **narthex** (vestibule).
* **Construction Details:** Because the basilica was built directly on the Vatican cemetery, its construction required **crypts and vaults** to incorporate the pre-existing graves, ensuring the preservation of the sacred ground, including the presumed tomb of Peter, which sat directly beneath the structure's focal point.
* The immense scale of the church allowed it to accommodate approximately **4,000 worshipers.**
##### The Catacombs (Page 301)
The Catacombs served as extensive underground burial grounds used by Early Christians, particularly in Rome:
* **Scope and Structure:** These cemeteries consisted of vast, complex networks of passageways and chambers, some systems extending up to **60 miles in length** and often reaching **three or four stories deep** below ground.
* **Burial Methods:** The primary burial method was the carving of individual niches, called **loculi**, stacked along the walls of the passageways. Small, rectangular chambers known as **cubicula** were also used. Larger, arched openings, called **arcosolia**, held sarcophagi.
* **Function:** Although their primary purpose was burial, the catacombs also contained the graves of early popes and martyrs. While they were not suited for large-scale liturgical services, meals may have occasionally been held there.
##### Artistic Developments and Iconography (Pages 303–305)
Early Christian art utilized subjects drawn from both the Old and New Testaments for paintings and sculptures.

* **Fresco Subjects:** Wall paintings, especially in the catacombs (such as the Catacombs of Saints Peter and Marcellinus), frequently depicted narratives.
	* **Old Testament (OT):** Popular themes included **Adam and Eve**, the first humans to sin, and the **Sacrifice of Isaac**, where Abraham was commanded to sacrifice his son.
	* **New Testament (NT):** Important subjects included the **Adoration of the Magi** and Christ granting the keys of the kingdom to Peter.
	* **The Good Shepherd:** This symbol was ubiquitous, often showing Christ carrying a sheep across his shoulders, representing the shepherd who sought the lost sheep.
* **Sarcophagi:** Sculpture largely took the form of **sarcophagi**, which evolved from simple marble containers to highly decorated pieces.
	* **Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus:** This notable example, dated to the late fourth century, features intricate relief carvings detailing Christian narratives.
	* **Detail and Style:** The reliefs on sarcophagi, like the **Statues of Christ** and the scene of **Adam and Eve** on the Junius Bassus sarcophagus, show the increasing complexity and narrative focus of Early Christian sculpture, often drawing upon classical styles but adapting them for Christian theology.
	* The iconography sometimes depicted Christ enthroned, with his feet resting on the firmament, or above the personification of the sky god.

The transition from the private meeting houses of Dura-Europos to the colossal basilica of Old Saint Peter's illustrates the immense shift in Christian architecture, moving from hidden worship to monumental public spectacle.
### *Hopkins, A World Full of Gods*
##### Introduction
The introduction states that the purpose of the book is to recount the dramatic growth of Christianity in the Roman Empire during the first three centuries C.E..
* The Introduction sets the historical scene, noting that the real Jesus was a Jew who led a radical revisionist movement within Judaism. 
* By the end of the fourth century, Christianity had become the official state religion, leading to the **banning of pagan rites**. 
* The author describes the work as an experiment in writing religious history, combining traditional research with historical reportage and a TV drama format, aiming for a balance between historical objectivity and empathy. 
* The methodology involves studying Roman paganism, Judaism, and early Christianity by exploring variations in interpretation.
##### Arrival in Pompeii and the Forum
The core narrative begins with the time travel assignment of Martha and James, commissioned by King's College, to recover information on Roman religious practices in the first three centuries C.E.. Their first destination is Pompeii, chosen for the period shortly before the eruption of Vesuvius.
* Upon arrival, Martha is immediately struck by the difference between idealized views of antiquity and the messy reality, noting the pervasive presence of smells, flies, and dirt.
* To facilitate their research, they adopt the local personae of ambitious Greek/Pompeian immigrants: James as Cnaeus Stertinius Aquila and Martha as Stertinia Firenze.

**Archaeological Details of the Forum:** The travelers observe the bustling Forum, which is dominated by large, brightly colored temples, **marble statues**, and numerous **altars.** The environment is a "world full of gods". Specifically, Martha mentions the Temple of Jupiter and the **Temple of the Emperor Augustus**. The Forum's arch, dedicated to the emperor, was adorned with bronze statues and two large marble pedestals. They also note the prevalence of **graffiti** painted on walls across the city, containing political slogans, advertisements, and crude remarks.

* James buys three slaves at the Market Hall, noting that a slave dealer traded slaves away as if they were merely objects. 
* The two travelers also visit a private house where they observe a **small, obscure caricature of Aeneas and Anchises** and find a bronze bell shaped like a **phallus** dangling from the sacred chest of the household gods.
##### Public Spaces, Cults, and Domestic Life
* **The Baths and Erotic Art (Archaeology):** Martha describes visiting the public baths, likely the most visible, elaborate public architecture in the city. 
* She details the changing room (_apodyterium_), noting its elaborate decoration, **marble floor**, and a simple table used for depositing clothes. 
* She is shocked by the open display of nudity and public sexuality, including numerous **explicit pictures and carvings** depicting heterosexual and homosexual acts within the baths.

In similar nature to the apodyterium, James describes the low-reputation inn where they stayed.
* The inn walls were covered with **erotic murals**, including depictions associated with household gods or heroes. 
* He mentions finding a **bronze bell shaped like a phallus** hanging over the counter, and small clay statues of household gods (the Lares) were placed in niches. 
* The inn's garden wall displayed a large picture dedicated to the Goddess Fortuna.
##### Isis in Procession
**Isis in Procession (Ritual Iconography):** Martha observes the procession of Isis, highlighting that Roman religion was public, participatory, and spectacular, unlike early Christianity. 
* The formal procession included chief priests with shaved heads carrying various sacred objects. 
* These artifacts included the **golden cupola** (shaped like a boat), the **holy symbols** (a lantern shape and a gold piece), and a pitcher shaped like a woman's breast. 
* Other items were **vases used by Egyptians** to extract water from the Nile.

**Isis—A Conversion (Ritual Details):** James is initiated into the mysteries of Isis, a private rite involving symbolic death and rebirth. The ceremony included ritual cleansing and a descent into an **underground crypt** beneath the temple. James wore a **linen robe** during the initiation, symbolizing his new life.
##### A Wedding in the House of the Vettii (Domestic Archaeology/Architecture)
Martha visits the **House of the Vettii,** described as a beautifully decorated, large house.
* The house included a **colonnaded courtyard** (_peristyle_) featuring white-painted columns, with bases in red and gold, and statues.
* There was also an **atrium** with a fountain. The **entrance hall** was narrow and painted black and white. 
* The house contained multiple shrines to the household gods: one small temple dedicated to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, and another for the **Lares and the Genius of Popaeus** (found on the house's south side).

The wedding preparations involved a **pig sacrifice.** The bride, Lucretia, wore a traditional six-part hairstyle (_sex crines_) and a veil. The groom's priest, Lucretius, officiated the prayers and sacrifices.
##### Bloody Games (Archaeology and Public Culture) 
James attends the brutal gladiatorial games, noting the violent excitement of the crowd. 
* Archaeological evidence for the popularity of the games is seen in the **posters and frescoes painted on street walls** promoting the events and naming the star gladiator, Crescens. 
* The public enthusiasm was further commercialized, evidenced by local shops selling **bronze bells attached to gladiators posing**. 
* Following the games, a public banquet was held at the Temple of Augustus, where **sacrificed bull and pig** were eaten.
### *J. Liebeschuetz: The Decline and Fall of the Roman City*

The period around AD 650 saw a transformation of Western Europe, evidenced by a dramatic shift in the material aspects of life. Across the West, from Britain to Thrace, building construction shifted massively from stone to the use of **wood, wattle, and clay**. Even churches were infrequently built after 600 AD, although Lombard Italy shows evidence of church building between 600 and 800 AD.
##### Late Roman Cities
Urban archaeology reveals a pattern of decline followed by the beginnings of renewal. By the sixth century, the classical _polis_ structure was largely transformed in most Western regions, marked by the **abandonment of the forum** and monumental structures in the civic center. Collective life simplified toward private life, with residential space spreading throughout the entire city.

* Older properties were frequently subdivided for multi-occupation, rather than large new houses being constructed. For instance, a large peristyle house at Argos, built during the Empire, was **subdivided around AD 530** and subsequently declined.
* Excavations in Rome and Brescia suggest a drastic drop in living standards. In Brescia, fifth-century Roman _domus_ were partitioned, destroyed, leveled, and then occupied by **scattered groups of wooden, timber, or wattle and clay huts** built among earth and debris.
* In the area of the Roman _signoria_ (like Frascati and Florence), while the urban fabric was potentially maintained until the early fifth century, deep deposits of dark soil, often up to **2 meters deep**, covered Roman remains, indicating paved areas had been abandoned.

As for newer structures, typical Late Late Roman city dwelling in Italy was a **clustered, two-storied structure** of small dimensions, often built without stone foundations. Public buildings were often recycled for their materials.
* The decay of the civic center is emphasized by the shift from stone and brick to wood construction.
* Burials began appearing within the older urban structures, clustered around churches, or monastic centers.
##### Regional Shifts and External Impact
The maintenance of large works depended almost entirely on **public and clerical patronage** as public building programs largely halted. In Brescia, construction shows renewal in the seventh century, including the construction of S. Salvador and the S. Giulia monastery under King Desiderius in the 750s. The long-term fate of cities in Lombardy varied. 
* The Gothic wars involving Justinian led to the destruction of many middle Byzantine cities and institutions. 
* The Lombards, arriving in **AD 568**, seized territories in northern Italy, transforming the structure of the Western world into an **agricultural state.**
##### Arab Conquest
The Arab conquest also had severe consequences. Cities in Islamic Spain, such as Seville, Merida, and Valencia, suffered negative effects. Carthage’s classical layout was lost and eventually replaced by the Arab foundation of **Qairawan** (AD 670), marking the end of Roman occupation there around the mid-seventh century.
##### Reduction in the Number of Rural Sites
Archaeological surveys indicate a steady reduction in rural settlements beginning around the end of the second century, intensifying through the fourth and fifth centuries. This decline was accompanied by a concentration of land ownership in large latifundia.
* Field survey data reveals a **catastrophic decline in Campania**, where 390–445 sites in the third century fell to just 53 by the end of the fifth century
* This suggests that the **decline of the countryside preceded the city's decline.**
* In the Tiber valley, settled sites were reduced by 75% between the fourth and mid-sixth centuries.
* In Lucania/Bruttium, land was reorganized into _mansi_ (farm estates).
##### The Breakdown of the Distribution System
The widely accepted cause for the collapse of the Roman economy in the West is the **fifth-century decline in the exchange system.** Evidence rests primarily on the rapid decline of imported **African Red Slip ware (ARS)**. The Vandal occupation of North Africa (mid-fifth century) largely stopped ARS exports to the West, shifting trade toward the East.

By the sixth century, pottery found in the West was generally produced locally for domestic use, not traded long distance. The end of the _annona_ (public grain subsidy) system required cities to transport large quantities of necessary bulk goods, which became too expensive.
##### Shrinking Technology
Archaeological findings suggest a reduction in the standard of living and a significant simplification of technology. Houses were usually built of wood, wattle, or earth, often lacking stone foundations. Complex construction techniques, such as using horizontal trenching for large stone foundations, were used less often.
* Stone construction was rarely used until the Lombard period.
* Pottery use was substantially reduced, focusing on functional forms. The difficulty for specialized crafting personnel to sustain a living contributed to this reduction in specialization, with metal-working only concentrating in a few centers by the tenth century.
##### Population Crisis

A critical factor in the decay of cities was **population loss.** The abandonment of large spaces within cities points toward significant depopulation or concentration into smaller areas.

* Massive demographic setbacks were caused by the **plague of Marcus Aurelius** (c. AD 166–175) and a further **catastrophic plague in the mid-sixth century,** which hindered demographic recovery well into the mid-eighth century. 
* Furthermore, the combination of endemic warfare and heavy taxation, especially following the division of Italy into Byzantine and Lombard zones, blocked recovery,. 
* It is estimated that the population of Italy had shrunk to a fraction of what it had been during the Early Empire.

The end result was the **decay of the civic center**, characterized by simplified housing construction (a shift from stone to wood and brick) and the building of clustered huts within the ruins of older monuments, reflecting a severe lowering of living standards that began potentially as early as AD 400.
