A MONOPOLY often refers to when a market is dominated by one firm or party, who faces no direct competitors, and who can raise its price without losing customers to any potential competitors. In other words, the market demand is identical to the firm demand, since the firm is the market.
##### Perfect Competition vs. Monopoly
The demand curve remains unaffected should a perfectly competitive market be converted into a monopoly. However, market supply (MC) and equilibrium are affected since **the market supply curve becomes the marginal cost curve (MC).** The result is that a monopoly produces less and charges more compared to perfect competition. Furthermore, because of the nature of monopolies, higher barriers to entry make entering the market significantly more difficult for potential competitors, making a monopolist's economic profits higher than the total of competitive firms' profits.

See [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)|DEADWEIGHT LOSS]] to understand the deadweight loss that might be created from a monopoly.
# Monopoly Profit Maximization
* **Note that a monopoly does not have a supply curve,** since the supply curve represents the quantity supplied at a particular price. In a monopoly the profit-maximizing quantity is determined where $MC=MR$. Note, however, that the monopoly will not price the good at the marginal cost, since the firm affords to charge what the market values their good at. This is in contrast to perfect competition where the profit-maximizing price is determined at $Q_D=MC$.
* Changes in fixed costs will never affect production or pricing conditions. However, they can affect total costs and subsequently affect profits. Changes in variable costs can affect the marginal cost at each level of output. As $\downarrow MC$, monopoly price decreases, and as $\uparrow MC$, monopoly price increases.
##### Efficiency and Externalities
A monopoly will generally create a deadweight loss, however, the nature of this deadweight loss varies depending on the existence and social impact of externalities. The general trend is that monopolies produce below the quantity produced at market equilibrium for a higher price, creating DWL. But with the presence of negative externalities, it is also very possible that a monopoly will overproduce given the firm's goal is to maximize private benefit rather than social benefit. The result is that both taxes and subsidies are used should the monopoly fail to produce at $Q_E$.

* A corrective tax is used if the $MSB<MSC$, where the $MSC$ is the result of negative externalities. This tax increases marginal private cost (MPC) for the firm and artificially reduces the supply to the socially efficient quantity.
* If the $MSC<MSB$, the opposite is done where a government subsidy reduces the MPC, allowing the monopoly to increase supply and subsequently increase the social benefit to the socially efficient quantity.
# Natural Monopoly
A natural monopoly is a scenario in which it is inefficient to have perfect competition, a monopoly makes more sense than having too much bloat. Features:
* Downward sloping ATC, since the majority of the cost is represented by the fixed cost (FC). See: **economies of scale.** As $Q\uparrow$, $ATC\downarrow$. 
* When ATC is downward sloping, the MC curve is below that of the ATC.
##### Shortages
Because of the nature of monopoly and the need to maximize profit, shortages are commonplace. The government considers two methods to achieve this:
* **Marginal cost pricing**, which forces the producer to produce the quantity at $MC=Q_D$, instead of $MC=MR$. But at this point, $P_{MCP}<ATC$, which is solved through a per-unit subsidy: $(ATC-MC)\times Q_{MCP}$.
* **Average cost pricing model,** which forces the produce where $ATC=Q_D$. This is less than socially efficient but better for the business since the $P_{ACP}=ATC$. 
##### Calculating Lump Sum Subsidy
This will only be relevant when the marginal cost curve is flat and essentially $VC=MC$. The socially efficient quantity is at $Q_D=D$. The question will ask the subsidy required to offset the loss created by the monopolist. The profit is represented by $\pi=P_S-FC$. If $P_S<0$, the firm loses the fixed cost (FC).
The formula for FC **and the subsidy necessary to offset the lost fixed cost** is, at any quantity:
$$
Q\times(AC-MC)
$$
# Perfect Price Discrimination
Perfect price discrimination: form of dynamic pricing where exchange takes place. In PPD, demand equals marginal revenue ($Q_D=MR$). There is no deadweight loss from perfect price discrimination, however, all surplus goes to the producer. Therefore it is always socially efficient.

To achieve PPD a firm must have:
* Market power so the firm may dictate prices
* Ability to prevent resale (e.g., region-locked electronic media)
* Identify consumers willing to pay more (groupings)
##### Externalities
Inefficiencies that occur because of social costs that arise from PPD can be corrected with a government subsidy or tax, $t=MEC$ to achieve $Q_E$.
