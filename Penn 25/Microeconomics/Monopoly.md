A MONOPOLY often refers to when a market is dominated by one firm or party, who faces no direct competitors, and who can raise its price without losing customers to any potential competitors. In other words, the market demand is identical to the firm demand, since the firm is the market.
##### Perfect Competition vs. Monopoly
The demand curve remains unaffected should a perfectly competitive market be converted into a monopoly. However, market supply (MC) and equilibrium are affected since **the market supply curve becomes the marginal cost curve (MC).** The result is that a monopoly produces less and charges more compared to perfect competition. Furthermore, because of the nature of monopolies, higher barriers to entry make entering the market significantly more difficult for potential competitors, making a monopolist's economic profits higher than the total of competitive firms' profits.

See [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)|DEADWEIGHT LOSS]] to understand the deadweight loss that might be created from a monopoly.
## Monopoly  Profit Maximization
* **Note that a monopoly does not have a supply curve,** since the supply curve represents the quantity supplied at a particular price. In a monopoly the profit-maximizing quantity is determined where $MC=MR$, and the monopoly will charge the price on the demand curve. This is in contrast to perfect competition where the profit-maximizing quantity is determined at $Q_D=MC$. Subsequently, $P>MC$.  
* Changes in fixed costs will never affect production or pricing conditions. However, they can affect total costs and subsequently affect profits.
* Changes in variable costs can affect the marginal cost at each level of output. As $\downarrow MC$, monopoly price decreases, and as $\uparrow MC$, monopoly price increases.
##### Socially Efficient Quantity
In a monopoly, the $Q_E$ for the firm is where $P=MC$. 
* A tax is used if 
## Perfect Price Discrimination
Perfect price discrimination: form of dynamic pricing where exchange takes place 
Inefficiencies that occur because of social costs that arise from PPD can be corrected with a government subsidy or tax, $t=MEC$ to achieve $Q_E$.
