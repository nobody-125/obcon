### Opportunity Cost
Opportunity cost is calculated as the direct monetary cost of a choice, plus the net benefit of the next best choice:
$$
OC=DMC+NBA
$$
Where DMC = *direct monetary cost* and NBA = *net benefit of next best choice*
### Good Kinds
Economists classify goods into three categories based on how consumers' expenditure on them shifts as a result of the income and substitution effects.
* Normal good: A good that has a perceived high quality or value. When consumer's **actual income** is stronger (IE), consumers purchase more normal goods, when consumers' actual income is weaker (SE), consumers tend to purchase fewer normal goods. 
* Inferior good: A good that has a perceived lower quality or value. When consumer's actual income is stronger (IE), consumers purchase fewer inferior goods, when consumer actual income is weaker (SE), consumers tend to purchase more inferior goods.

Likewise, they may be classified into the categories of luxuries and ordinary goods:
* Luxury: A subset of normal goods with a higher INCOME ELASTICITY, when actual income is higher, demand for it rises more than proportionally ($E_D>1$).
* Ordinary good: A kind of good for which quantity demanded decreases when its **own price** increases.
##### Substitutes vs. Complements
Goods are split into two categories, complements and substitutes, in the majority of cases, this is an either-or situation (if one is to only consume two kinds of goods).
