### Good Kinds
Economists classify goods into three categories based on how consumers' expenditure on them shifts as a result of the income and substitution effects.
* Normal good: A good that has a perceived high quality or value. When consumer income is stronger (IE), consumers purchase more normal goods, when consumer income is weaker (SE), consumers tend to purchase fewer normal goods.
* Inferior good: A good that has a perceived lower quality or value. When consumer income is stronger (IE), consumers purchase fewer inferior goods, when consumer income is weaker (SE), consumers tend to purchase more inferior goods.
