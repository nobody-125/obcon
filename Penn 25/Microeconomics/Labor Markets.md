There exists one more market that is unique from the markets that belong to the majority of goods and services, that is the labor market itself. While labor itself can be considered a service, the relevance of said service is directly tied to the demand for the services produced by that labor. 
### Marginal Product of Labor
The effectiveness of labor is often framed through either marginal product of labor, or its cousin, the marginal revenue product of labor:
* **Marginal Product of Labor:** The additional output produced from hiring an additional worker
* **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor:** The marginal revenue from hiring an additional worker. The  MRP<sub>L</sub>, is calculated by $MRP_L=MP_L\times MR$. The marginal cost is represented by the wage, W. 
The MRP<sub>L</sub> can be considered a derived demand since it is contingent on demand for the service that the labor provides; when demand for such a service rises, the marginal revenue gained from additional labor increases. 
##### Rational Rule
According to the rational rule, employers will continue hiring until the wage, W, equals the marginal revenue product of the last worker hired ($MRP_L=W$). This labor demand curve also serves as the employer's marginal revenue product curve.

> [!MARKET WAGE AND LAW OF DEMAND]
> Note that in the graph, labor demand is downward sloping, since as the wage decreases, the employers will want to hire more employees. This phenomenon (law of demand) may explain why minimum wage hikes often times reduce the supply of jobs, since employers cannot necessarily afford to pay the same amount of employees a greater sum of money, and henceforth, the supply of jobs is reduced whilst the employee(s) that retain their jobs are entrusted with more responsibilities than if their wage was lower.
