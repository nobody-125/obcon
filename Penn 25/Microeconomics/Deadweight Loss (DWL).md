Deadweight loss is a loss of total surplus relative to a Pareto-efficient allocation. A market is usually pareto-efficient at **equilibrium,** where both parties are maximizing utility; it is the price and quantity at which it is impossible to improve utility of both buyers and sellers. If sellers were to increase price, it would be at the cost of the buyer, and if the buyer were to purchase at a lower price, it would be at the cost of the seller.
# Price Controls
* Efficiency is achieved at the intersection between demand and marginal cost (MC).  The first figure illustrates DWL as a result of underproduction, the second as a result of overproduction.

##### Shortcuts
* **Deadweight loss appears as an arrowhead pointed at efficient quantity** This will make it easier to identify DWL. 
* **Quantity is the superior measure for DWL** Since deadweight loss is a measure of consequences for producing the inefficient quantity of goods, price is less relevant to calculating DWL.
# Deadweight Loss from Price Controls
When PRICE CONTROLS are imposed, market efficiency and equilibrium are intentionally disrupted by an external force, which is usually the government. The market will no longer operate at an equilibrium, resulting in different kinds of distortions. 

For instance, when an effective price ceiling is imposed in housing (rent controls), both tenants and landlords are forced to make transactions at an artificially lower price, increasing demand for the good. In a free market, landlords would raise the price of housing to restore equilibrium, but with price controls, this is no longer possible, resulting in shortages. A price floor, like raising the minimum wage, has similar effects.
##### Calculate DWL
1. Assuming one has SUPPLY and DEMAND equations, solve for *P* and *Q* at **equilibrium**
2. If a PRICE CEILING or PRICE FLOOR is given, substitute those in to find:
	1. . P<sub>d</sub>, the price buyers are willing to pay: solve for using demand equation
	2. P<sub>s</sub>, the price sellers receive: solve for using the supply equation
	3. Q<sub>s</sub>, the quantity sold result of the control
3. Solve for DWL:
$$
DWL=\frac{1}{2} \times (P_d-P_s)(Q_e-Q_s)
$$
DWL is also calculated as the area of the triangle when graphed.

Consider the following:

* The graph above illustrates how the monopoly sells at quantity and price $Q_M + P_M$. The smaller output and higher price generate a wedge between MB (market demand curve) and MC. The gray area represents the DWL, as consumer surplus shrinks as a result of the higher prices and lower supply.
