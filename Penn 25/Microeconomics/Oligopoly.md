A market with an OLIGOPOLY provides only a handful of sellers. It arises from the same barriers to entry that [[MONOPOLY|MONOPOLIES]] arise from, in this way, it can be considered a weaker form of a monpoly.
# Payoff Matrix
 The PAYOFF MATRIX is a table illustrating the actions of a number of agents, where each agent's actions results in a different payoff. 
 * A dominant strategy is when a choice is the most rational action regardless of the action taken by the other player, think of the maximin principle.
 * When everyone is maximizing their own utility, the game reaches nash equilibrium
### Other Games
##### Prisoner's Dilemma
IPD illustrates why cooperation is often difficult in economics, since the prospect of refusal to cooperate tempts agents into a maximax mindset, when in reality, if all agents cooperated, both agents would receive more benefit than if neither of them did. 
The grim trigger strategy is one way to overcome the prisoner's dilemma, in which one player will cooperate as long as the other player does, but the moment cooperation halts, both players choose to defect.
### Chicken
Chicken is an "anti-coordination" game because both players are better off if they can coordinate their choices, but each equilibrium favors a different player. There exist two equilibriums in the classical representation of chicken where two cars are on path to crash into each other, if they do crash there is a loss, if one car swerves, that car loses but not as much as if crashed and the car that stays on path gains, if both swerve, there is nothing gained or lost.
##### Stag Hunt
