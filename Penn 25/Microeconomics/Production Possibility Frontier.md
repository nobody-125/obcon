PRODUCTION POSSIBILITY FRONTIER, or PPF, is a measure of outputs possible given limited resources. PPF presents us with trade-offs where an agent gives up one thing to get more of another. Imagine a scenario with two goods, good $X$ and good $Y$. Let's assume that in 1 hour, an agent can obtain either 15 of good $X$ or 30 of good $Y$. The opportunity cost of one of $Y$ is 2 $X$. 
## Specialization
When multiple parties choose to jointly produce, they will rationally specialize in production of goods that they are most efficient at, in other words, producing goods they have the greatest **comparative advantage in**. This does not refer to if they can produce the largest number of those goods **(absolute advantage)**, but instead production of goods where they face the lowest opportunity cost.
