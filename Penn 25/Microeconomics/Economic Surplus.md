* Surplus in microeconomics refers to the excess of supply over demand at a given price, which can lead to downward pressure on prices. 
	* **Consumer surplus** is the marginal benefit consumers receive when they pay less than what they are willing to pay.
	* **Producer surplus** is the benefit producers receive when they sell, compared to if they did not.
### Consumer Surplus

* The consumer surplus is represented by the area of the shaded triangle, where $Q_e$ is equilibrium quantity and $P^*$ is price (Max. price consumers are willing to pay, minus equilibrium price):
$$
CS=\frac{1}{2}\times(Q_e)\times(P_{max}-P_e)
$$
### Producer Surplus
* $PS(q)=TR(q)-VC(q)$
	* **Distinctive from profit:** Profit is total revenue net of all costs, whereas the equation above shows that producer surplus ignores fixed costs.
	* Nevertheless, profit-maximizing quantity is identical to PS-maximizing quantity. 
* Calculating producer surplus is similar to calculating consumer surplus:
$$
PS=\frac{1}{2}\times (Q_e)\times(P_e-P_{min})
$$
### Trade
Surplus under free trade is calculated similar to domestic CS/PS, only using world prices.
$$
PS^T=\frac{1}{2}\times (P_w-P_{min})\times Q_{s}^{*}
$$
$$
CS^T=\frac{1}{2}\times (P_{max}-P_{w})\times Q_{d}^{*}
$$
*Where $Q_s$ and $Q_d$ are the quantities supplied/demanded at the **world price.**
