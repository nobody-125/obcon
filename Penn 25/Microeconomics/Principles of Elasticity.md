### Price Elasticity of Demand
* A good's price elasticity of demand, or E<sub>D</sub> is a measure of how sensitive quantity demanded is to the price. The general trend is that when price increases, quantity demanded decreases ($P\uparrow \Rightarrow Q_{D}\downarrow$).
* The formula for price elasticity is:
$$E_{D}=\frac{\%\Delta Q_{D}}{\%\Delta P}$$
* **Arc Elasticity:** Note that *arc elasticity* is usually relevant when calculating elasticity, since it eliminates the natural bias associated with choice of base point:
$$
\Delta Q\%=\frac{E.Value-S.Value}{Midpoint}\times100
$$

The majority of the time in questions, elasticity will be downward sloping (but linear as compared to unitary elastic demand). In a graph where elasticity is a linear downward sloping curve, the midpoint is considered to be unit elastic ($E_D=1$). Note that also as the demand curve becomes steeper, demand becomes more inelastic.
