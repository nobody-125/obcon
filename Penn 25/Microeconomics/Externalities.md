EXTERNALITIES are the side effects generated from an exchange or activity, these can be either positive or negative.
## External Costs
##### Negative Costs from Production
In the context of SELLER CHOICE, marginal cost (MC) referred to private costs for the firm in operation - cost of labor, purchasing supplies, transportation. Externalities extend this definition by including the **marginal social cost,** taking into effect the positive or negative effects that operation might have on society.
$$
MSC=MC+MEC
$$
Where MSC is marginal social cost, MC is marginal private cost, and MEC is the marginal external cost.
The MEC is represented as the difference in height between the private cost/benefit and the social benefit:

##### Negative Costs from Consumers
Similar to marginal cost is **marginal private benefit** (MB), the personal satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. The marginal private benefit curve equals the demand curve ($MB=Q_d$). The **marginal social benefit** accounts for the potential harm caused by consumption of these goods:
$$
MSB=MB-MEC
$$

##### Positive Externalities from Producers
If producers are creating positive EXTERNAL BENEFIT, it is represented by $MSC=MB-MEB$. Note that the curve is upward-sloping since the benefits created by producers increase with quantity:

## Socially Efficient Outcome
The rational rule for society governs that an item should be produced in larger quantities insofar that it confers greater marginal social benefits on society ($MSB \geq MSC$):

### Calculating Loss from Negative Externalities
* Knowing the socially efficient quantity makes it possible to determine social surplus, which is the sum of producer and consumer surplus ($PS+CS$). 
* Visually, this is the area below **demand** (MPB) and above **supply** (MPC) for quantities up to the socially efficient quantity. 
* Since each unit produced generates a marginal external cost equal to the vertical distance between MPC and MSC, the total external cost is the area between the two for all quantities up until the socially efficient quantity. Total social surplus is therefore the difference between the total surplus (TS) and the area of the externality:

$a+b$ represents total surplus, b represents the cost of the externality, therefore the total social surplus area is only a.
##### Private Market Equilibrium
* The total private surplus will be the area below demand (MSB) and above supply (MPC) up to market quantity (Q<sub>1</sub>). This area is $a+b+e$.
* The cost of all externalities is the area between MPC and MSC for all quantities up to market quantity (Q<sub>1</sub>). This area is $b+e+d$. 
* The total social surpls is subsequently $a-d$, representing the inefficiencies resulting from operating at the efficient market quantity rather than the socially efficient quantity. The area d will also represent the [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)|DEADWEIGHT LOSS]] from not operating at the socially efficient quantity.
