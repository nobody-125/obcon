EXTERNALITIES are the side effects generated from an exchange or activity, these can be either positive or negative.
## External Costs
##### Negative Costs from Production
In the context of SELLER CHOICE, marginal cost (MC) referred to private costs for the firm in operation - cost of labor, purchasing supplies, transportation. Externalities extend this definition by including the **marginal social cost,** taking into effect the positive or negative effects that operation might have on society.
$$
MSC=MPC+MEC
$$
Where *MSC* is marginal social cost, *MPC* is marginal private cost, and *MEC* is the marginal external cost.
The *MEC* is represented as the difference in height between the private cost/benefit and the social benefit:

##### Negative Costs from Consumers
Similar to marginal cost is **marginal private benefit** (MB), the personal satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. The marginal private benefit curve equals the demand curve ($MB=Q_d$). The **marginal social benefit** accounts for the potential harm caused by consumption of these goods:
$$
MSB=MB-MEC
$$

##### Positive Externalities from Producers
If producers are creating positive EXTERNAL BENEFIT, it is represented by $MSC=MB-MEB$. Note that the curve is upward-sloping since the benefits created by producers increase with quantity:

## Socially Efficient Outcomes
The rational rule for society governs that an item should be produced in larger quantities insofar that it confers greater marginal social benefits on society ($MSB \geq MSC$):
* In perfect competition questions **where the externality is negative** $MSB=D$ and $MSC=MPC+MEC$. Therefore, to determine the socially efficient quantity, equate $MSB=(MPC+MEC)$. 
* If the **externality is positive,** $MSB=D+MEB$, equate $MSB=MPC$ to determine the socially efficient quantity.
### Loss from Negative Externalities
##### Calculating Social Surplus at the Socially Efficient Equilibrium
* Knowing the socially efficient quantity makes it possible to determine social surplus, which is the sum of producer and consumer surplus ($PS+CS$). 
* Visually, this is the area below **demand** (MPB) and above **supply** (MPC) for quantities up to the socially efficient quantity. 
* Since each unit produced generates a marginal external cost equal to the vertical distance between MPC and MSC, the total external cost is the area between the two for all quantities up until the socially efficient quantity. Total social surplus is therefore the difference between the total surplus (TS) and the area of the externality:

$a+b$ represents total surplus, b represents the cost of the externality, therefore the total social surplus area is only a.
##### Calculating Social Surplus at the Unregulated Equilibrium
* The total private surplus will be the area below demand (MSB) and above supply (MPC) up to market quantity (Q<sub>1</sub>). This area is $a+b+e$.
* The cost of all externalities is the area between MPC and MSC for all quantities up to market quantity (Q<sub>1</sub>). This area is $b+e+d$. 
* The total social surplus is subsequently $a-d$, representing the inefficiencies resulting from operating at the efficient market quantity rather than the socially efficient quantity. The area d will also represent the [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)|DEADWEIGHT LOSS]] from not operating at the socially efficient quantity.
### Loss from Positive Externalities
The external benefits generated by positive externalities are represented by $MSB=MPB+MEB$. The market will only produce $Q_{market}<Q_{efficient}$ when marginal private cost (MPC) equals marginal private benefit (MPB), where $MPC=MPB$. 
##### Calculating Social Surplus at the Socially Efficient Equilibrium
* The total private surplus will be the area below the demand (MPB) and above supply (MPC) up to the socially efficient quantity, in this case, Q<sub>2</sub>.
* Total private surplus will equal to area $b-f$ in the graph below:
![[Pasted image 20251110130514.png]]
* Total social surplus will be the area $b-f$, plus the total benefit of the externality, represented by $a+d+f$.
* The total social surplus is therefore, simplified, $a+b+d$.
##### Calculating Social Surplus at the Unregulated Equilibrium
* At market quantity Q<sub>1</sub>, total social surplus is $a+b$. 
* The [[Deadweight Loss (DWL)|DEADWEIGHT LOSS]] is again represented by area d.

> [!Inefficency]
> In the case of negative externalities, consumers make decisions based on private costs and benefits and normally consume where their marginal private benefits and costs are equal. Given that there are external marginal costs, the marginal social costs must be greater and thus we are not producing and consuming allocatively efficient amounts.
> 
> In the case of positive externalities, The market will produce where the private marginal cost equals the private marginal benefit. When there are external benefits, the marginal social benefit is above the marginal private benefit. Therefore, where the market produces the marginal social benefit will be higher than the marginal cost, which means the amount produced is inefficient. We could improve efficiency by producing more.
## Potential Solution
Duchene proposes two potential solutions, the Coase Theorem, and gov't intervention.
##### Coase Theorem
The Coase theorem tries to provide a framework for how the issue of externalities might be solved without government intervention, through individual transaction. According to the theorem, iff property rights are well defined and transaction costs are low, a solution will arise to allocate resources in a socially efficient manner. 
##### Intervention - Taxes and Subsidies
* If the government is attempting to correct a perfectly competitive market where there is a marginal external cost, a tax equal to the *MEC* will be used ($t=MEC$)
* If the government is correcting the perfectly competitive market where there is a external benefit, a subsidy will be used ($s=MEB$).
