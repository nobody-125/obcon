EXTERNALITIES are the side effects generated from an exchange or activity, these can be either positive or negative.
## External Costs
##### Negative Costs from Production
In the context of SELLER CHOICE, marginal cost (MC) referred to private costs for the firm in operation - cost of labor, purchasing supplies, transportation. Externalities extend this definition by including the **marginal social cost,** taking into effect the positive or negative effects that operation might have on society.
$$
MSC=MC+MEC
$$
Where MSC is marginal social cost, MC is marginal private cost, and MEC is the marginal external cost.
The MEC is represented as the difference in height between the private cost/benefit and the social benefit:

##### Negative Costs from Consumers
Similar to marginal cost is **marginal private benefit** (MB), the personal satisfaction gained from consuming one more unit of a good or service. The marginal private benefit curve equals the demand curve ($MB=Q_d$). The **marginal social benefit** accounts for the potential harm caused by consumption of these goods:

MSB=MB-MEC

##### Positive Externalities from Producers
If producers are creating positive EXTERNAL BENEFIT, it is represented by $MSC=MB-MEB$. Note that the curve is upward-sloping since the benefits created by producers increase with quantity:
